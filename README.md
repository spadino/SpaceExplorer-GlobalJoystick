# SpaceExplorer, as a Global joystick

It allow a 3dConnexion space mouse (in this case, a SpaceExplorer) to globally behave like a joystick. Replace your "$USER\AppData\Roaming\3Dconnexion\3DxWare\Cfg\Global.xml" file with this one. If you prefer to only allow it on specific app, copy the relevant device setup in $YourApp.xml file.

To adjust the sensitivity, modify the scale value; a 0.4 value, as per default, allow for the maximum and minimum axis value when the spacemouse is at its physical maximum. The 1.0 3dConnexion default is pretty fast moving, reaching the maximum and the minimum far before reaching the physical limit...
